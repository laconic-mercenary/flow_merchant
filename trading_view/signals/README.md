## About
Use the JSON signals found in this folder to create webhooks in trading view.

## Confluence
Use this when you want confluence in your trades. The HIGH interval acts as confluence, and the LOW interval acts as the entry for trades. The HIGH interval will have a BUY and a SELL alert, where as the LOW interval will have just a BUY. (Total of 3 alerts)

### Example
LOW: 5 min
HIGH: 1 hour

## No Confluence
Use this when you don't need confluence - just trade on that interval based on the indicator in trading view. (Total of 1 alert)
